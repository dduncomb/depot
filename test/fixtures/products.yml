# Read about fixtures at http://ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/Fixtures.html

# fixtures can be used instead of factories (e.g. FactoryGirl gem!)
# each fixture contains the data for a single model

# like in config/database.yml, use spaces not tabs at line start, and all lines for a
# (table) row must have same indentation
